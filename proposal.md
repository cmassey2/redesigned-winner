# X-Team 19 Grade Reporter Project Proposal

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

We are going to do a grade reporter porgram which displays the exam results of the class and personal exam report to individual. This program will need to ask the professor for all the scores and names of the class, and then generate a exam report to students. Main.java is the class that we will use to create the hash table/ avl tree, and then import the data added from the professor, or edit the data, or delete the data based on our interface below. JUnit testing to test the hash table and AVL tree class. And we will also create Hashtable and AVL Tree structure to store the data.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Grade Reporter


2. Output: 

The exam report of the class: mean, range, mode, distribution graph.
The individual report: individual exam score, current standing in this class.

3. Input: 

The names of the students in this class and the exam scores of the whole class.

4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.
Welcome to Grade Distribution 2018, are you a professor or a students:
-I am a Professor:                                                -I am a Students:
1) Add individual with score                                      1) Your score:
2) Delete individual with score                                   2) Your current standing
3) Edit student with score                                        3) Get mean, range, and grade distribution
4) Get mean, range, and grade distribution                         
5) Find students score with grade standing




5. Types List: 
Student Information Class to store the information of the students; Hash Table Class to find the score via name as key; AVL Tree Class for range, mean, and grade distribution.
