# X-Team 19 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## 1. Meet on time (text/message if you're going to be late or miss)
## 2. Communicate frequently 
## 3. Use GroupMe to communicate
## 4. Split up work evenly based on preferred data structur/ skills
## 5. Meet as a team once a week, and message each other frequently
## 6. Ask specific problems about difficulties and communicate via groupme.
## 7. Always finish projects one day before the deadline.
